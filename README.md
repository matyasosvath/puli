# PULI Language Models

The repository contains the implementation of the PULI language models for Hungarian language processing using PyTorch. The PULI models include variations such as PULI GPT-3SX, PULI GPT-2, and PULI BERT-Large, and are trained on large-scale corpora to support various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This project is part of ongoing research and aims to provide high-performance Hungarian language models accessible to the broader NLP community.

## Description

The PULI language models are state-of-the-art models designed for Hungarian text processing, trained on a corpus exceeding 32 billion words. These models utilize different architectures, such as GPT-2, GPT-3-like (GPT-3SX), and BERT-Large, to cater to a variety of NLP tasks. The models are freely available for research purposes and can be accessed on the Hugging Face Model Hub under the following repositories:
